        "     EL SALVADOR HAS CARRIED OUT A CONSTANT AND PERMANENT AGGRESSION AGAINST NICARAGUA AND NICARAGUA HAS NEVER SUGGESTED BREAKING RELATIONS WITH EL SALVADOR. NICARAGUA HAS NOT EVEN THOUGHT ABOUT BREAKING RELATIONS WITH HONDURAS. ON THE CONTRARY, WE HAVE ALWAYS TRIED TO FOLLOW A POLICY OF NEGOTIATIONS TO SOLVE PROBLEMS.  I DO NOT BELIEVE IN FOOLING OURSELVES.  THE REAL PROBLEM HERE IS THAT THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS MADE A COMMITMENT, AND THAT COMMITMENT MUST BE FULFILLED. THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS MADE A COMMITMENT TO MOBILIZE THE CONTRAS; THAT COMMITMENT MUST BE FULFILLED.  THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS ALSO COMMITTED THEMSELVES TO RESPECTING HUMAN RIGHTS IN CENTRAL AMERICA, AND THAT COMMITMENT MUST ALSO BE FULFILLED.  EL SALVADOR MUST FULFILL THAT COMMITMENT. THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT IS NOT RESPECTING HUMAN RIGHTS IN EL SALVADOR, THEY ARE KILLING PEOPLE IN EL SALVADOR, THEY HAVE BOMBED THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE AND THEY HAVE KILLED THE JESUIT PRIESTS.     IN LIGHT OF ALL THIS, THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT MUST EXPRESS ITS SOLIDARITY WITH THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE; THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE ARE THE ONES WHO ARE SUFFERING.  WE CANNOT BE IN SOLIDARITY WITH AN ARMY THAT IS KILLING THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.  LET US WAIT AND SEE HOW MANY GOVERNMENTS WILL SUPPORT THAT ARMY WHICH IS KILLING THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE, AN ARMY THAT IS BOMBING THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE, AN ARMY THAT HAS KILLED THE JESUIT PRIESTS.  LET US WAIT AND SEE HOW MANY GOVERNMENTS WILL SUPPORT THE ARMY.  I ASSURE YOU THAT MOST OF THE PEOPLES OF THE WORLD, ALL THE PEOPLES OF THE WORLD WILL EXPRESS THEIR SUPPORT FOR THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE.     SHORTLY BEFORE COMING HERE THIS EVENING, I WAS WATCHING THE NEWS VIA SATELLITE, AND I SAW PROTEST DEMOSTRATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES. THE PEOPLE ARE PROTESTING THE KILLING OF THE JESUIT PRIESTS AND THE BOMBINGS IN EL SALVADOR.  CHRISTIANS, CATHOLICS, CLERGYMEN, AND PRIESTS ARE PROTESTING IN THE UNITED STATES . THEREFORE, OUR POSITION IS QUITE CLEAR.  WE DO NOT RENOUNCE THE PEACE AGREEMENTS.  WE CONTINUE TO DEFEND THEM, AND WE WILL DEMAND THAT THE AGREEMENTS BE FULFILLED.  WE ARE GOING TO DEMAND THAT THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT RESPECT THOSE AGREEMENTS AND RESPECT HUMAN RIGHTS.  WHAT IS NEEDED IN EL SALVADOR IS A CEASE-FIRE.  A REAL CEASE-FIRE AND NEGOTIATIONS ARE NEEDED IN EL SALVADOR TO REACH AN AGREEMENT THAT WILL ALLOW PEACE AND DEMOCRACY IN EL SALVADOR.  NO ONE CAN BE HAPPY WITH THAT KIND OF A DEMOCRATIC REGIME -- LIKE THE U.S. GOVERNMENT AND THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT DESCRIBE IT. THAT GOVERNMENT IS KNOWN FOR KILLING PEOPLE, FOR KILLING CLERGYMEN.  HUMAN RIGHTS MUST BE RESPECTED IN EL SALVADOR.     I AM GRATEFUL TO ALL THE COMRADES WHO CAME FROM THE VARIOUS REGIONS TO BE HERE TONIGHT TO ATTEND THIS MEETING DURING WHICH, IN ADDITION TO DISCUSSING SEVERAL MATTERS OF INTEREST FOR ALL THE NICARAGUAN PEOPLE, WE ALSO HONORED OUR EVANGELISTIC BROTHERS WHO HAVE WORKED HERE IN NICARAGUA FOR THE PAST 7 YEARS AND GAVE  POSTHUMOUS RECOGNITION TO OUR JESUIT BROTHERS, THE PRIESTS BRUTALLY MURDERED IN EL SALVADOR.   WE ARE DETERMINED TO         CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE CHRISTIAN PEOPLE, THE PREACHERS OF THE GOSPEL, THE EVANGELISTS AND ALL THE CHURCHES IN OUR COUNTRY, FOR A NICARAGUA IN PEACE AND DEMOCRACY.  ONCE AGAIN I WISH TO REITERATE: BETWEEN CHRISTIANITY AND REVOLUTION, THERE IS NO CONTRADICTION.   ",

IT WILL BE A JOURNEY OF STRUGGLE FOR A NEGOTIATED POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE CONFLICT. IT WILL BE A GREAT EFFORT TO CREATE A GREAT AND BROAD NATIONAL MOVEMENT IN WHICH THE MOST VARIED POLITICAL, SOCIAL, AND RELIGIOUS FORCES WOULD CONVERGE TO BEGIN SERIOUS NEGOTIATIONS -- BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMY ON ONE SIDE, AND THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT ON THE OTHER -- TO REACH AGREEMENTS THAT WILL BRING A JUST PEACE AND WILL THUS OPEN UP A STAGE OF ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT, DEMOCRACY, AND SELF-DETERMINATION.

SPEAKING AT THE ANDREWS AIR FORCE BASE, MARYLAND, ON MONDAY, THE PRESIDENT STRONGLY CRITICISED THE PREVAILING CONGRESSIONAL SENTIMENTS IN FAVOUR OF THE TERMINATION OF AID TO THE SALVADOREAN GOVERNMENT.

THE PRESIDENT ACCUSED THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT, FIGHTING FOR NATIONAL INDEPENDENCE AND DEMOCRACY, OF BEING FINANCED BY \"MARXISTS\".  MEANWHILE THE VOLUME OF WASHINGTON'S MILITARY AND ECONOMIC AID TO THE SALVADOREAN REGIME IS KNOWN TO EXCEED 1.5 MILLION DOLLARS.     \"TO CONTINUE TO HAVE A HANDFUL OF COUNTRIES AROUND -- A VERY SMALL HANDFUL -- SUPPORTING THE OUTDATED CONCEPT OF MARXIST GUERRILLAS, IS UNACCEPTABLE TO THE UNITED STATES,\" THE PRESIDENT SAID.  \"AND I AM TO TELL THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES THAT I WILL NOT ACCEPT, AS PRESIDENT, A CUT OFF OF AID TO EL SALVADOR,\" HE SAID.     THE PRESIDENT SAID \"WE CANNOT CONDONE KILLING\" IN EL SALVADOR, IGNORING THE FACT THAT THE NOTORIOUS \"DEATH SQUADS\", PARAMILITARY EXTREME RIGHT-WING FORMATIONS, HAVE KILLED SCORES OF THOUSANDS OF CIVILIANS IN THE PAST FEW YEARS.

        "    THE FIGHTING IN THE SAN SALVADOR RESIDENTIAL AREAS BRINGS UP SUBSTANTIAL DIFFERENCES IN THE FORM AND CONTENT OF THE WAR IN EL SALVADOR WHEN THE FIGHTING TAKES PLACE IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS OF THE POOR AND WHEN THE FIGHTING TAKES PLACE IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS OF THE RICH.  TODAY, WHEN THE FIGHTING TOOK PLACE IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE CAPITAL CITY, INCLUDING PLACES SUCH AS THE ESCALON, SAN BENITO, SAN FRANCISCO, AND GENERAL ARCE RESIDENTIAL AREAS WHERE U.S.  DIPLOMATIC PERSONNEL LIVE, WHERE THE MILITARY OFFICERS AND GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS HAVE THEIR RESIDENCES, WHERE THE SALVADORAN HIGH SOCIETY HAS ITS RESIDENCES, THEN THE REPERCUSSIONS ARE VERY DIFFERENT.     U.S. GOVERNMENT SPOKESMEN REACTED QUICKLY AND WITHOUT DELAY. MARLIN FITZWATER, JAMES BAKER, THE STATE DEPARTMENT, AMBASSADOR WALKER, EVERYONE WAS VERY WORRIED OVER THE FATE OF U.S. PERSONNEL. THEY EXPRESSED ANGRY WORDS AGAINST THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT .  IF THERE IS SOMEONE IN THE WORLD THAT IS WELL INFORMED OF THE WAR SITUATION IN EL SALVADOR, IT IS PRECISELY THE PENTAGON, THE STATE DEPARTMENT, AND THE U.S. EMBASSY, BECAUSE THEY HAVE FINANCED AND GIVEN ADVICE TO THE SALVADORAN ARMY.     IT IS NOT OUR PRESENCE IN THE SAN SALVADOR RESIDENTIAL AREAS THAT JEOPARDIZES U.S. PERSONNEL.  ON THE CONTRARY, IT IS THE U.S. PRESENCE, THE U.S. MEDDLING IN EL SALVADOR THAT IS JEOPARDIZING ITS STAFF.  THEY CANNOT ASK US TO GET OUT OF SAN SALVADOR SO THAT THE AMERICANS WILL NOT BE TRAPPED IN THE CROSSFIRE.  IT IS THE U.S. INTERVENTION IN THE COUNTRY THAT MUST COME TO AN END, SO THAT WE SALVADORANS WILL BE ABLE TO SETTLE OUR PROBLEMS AMONG OURSELVES.  THIS IS OUR LAND, OUR FATHERLAND.     THE WAR WAS IMPOSED BY THE INJUSTICES, THE SLAUGHTERS, THE DICTATORSHIPS, AND TO A GREAT EXTENT, BY THE AMERICANS WHO SPEND $1.4 MILLION DAILY IN THIS WAR.  THIS IS A CRUCIAL MOMENT FOR EL SALVADOR. THAT IS WHY WE DEMAND THAT THE U.S. ADMINISTRATION, THAT IS, THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION, THE U.S. CONGRESS, AND THE U.S. PEOPLE CAREFULLY THINK THIS OVER AND ACT SENSIBLY SO THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO PUT AN END TO THIS WAR.  IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT THE U.S.  GOVERNMENT -- THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION -- THINK THIS OVER AND PROMOTE CHANGES IN ITS POLICY TOWARD EL SALVADOR, AND THUS MAKE FEASIBLE A SOLUTION TO THE CONFLICT.     WE HAVE PUBLICLY AND OFFICIALLY SAID, AS ONE OF OUR MANY GESTURES OF GOOD WILL, THAT THE FMLN WILL NOT ATTACK U.S. DIPLOMATIC INSTALLATIONS OR PERSONNEL IN EL SALVADOR.  IN ADDITION, WE HAVE INSTRUCTED OUR UNITS, OUR FIGHTERS, AND COMMANDO GROUPS NOT TO ATTACK DIPLOMATIC SITES, BECAUSE NATURALLY THEY ARE NOT MILITARY TARGETS FOR THE FMLN.  WE HOPE THAT IN THE SAME MANNER, BOTH THE U.S. EMBASSY AS WELL AS THE OTHER DIPLOMATIC REPRESENTATIVES WILL INSTRUCT THEIR SECURITY GUARDS SO THEY WILL NOT BECOME INVOLVED IN THE FIGHTING, THUS PREVENTING CONFUSION THAT WE WOULD ALL REGRET.     THE U.S. GOVERNMENT CAN PLAY A POSITIVE ROLE IN DEFINING THE CONFLICT.  THE U.S. CONGRESS AND OTHER INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS, SUCH AS THE UNITED NATIONS AND THE OAS, ARE ALREADY DISCUSSING THE TRUE SITUATION OF OUR COUNTRY.  WE BELIEVE THIS IS THE MOMENT TO CHANGE POLICIES.  THE U.S. GOVERNMENT CANNOT CONTINUE TO FINANCE AND SUPPORT A REGIME WHICH IS BOMBING THE CIVILIAN POPULATION IN THE          CITIES, A REGIME WHICH MURDERS PRIESTS, WHICH PUBLICLY THREATENS THE      BISHOPS.  THE U.S. GOVERNMENT MUST USE ITS GOOD JUDGMENT AND CONTRIBUTE TO THE END OF THE WAR, AND NOT CONTINUE TO SUPPORT A FASCIST REGIME THAT IS NOT ACCEPTABLE IN OUR FATHERLAND, EL SALVADOR.
